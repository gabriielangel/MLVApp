- Demosaic bilinear or multithreaded AMaZE
- Processing with many parameters (exposure, white balance, saturation, dark & light adjustments, sharpen,…)
- Processing in sRGB or several LOG
- RAW corrections (fix focus & bad pixels, chroma smoothing, pattern noise, vertical stripes, deflicker)
- Support for dual ISO
- Show clip information
- Analysis: histogram, waveform monitor, RGB parade
- Session: open, import to, delete from, save, copy receipt, paste receipt (also batch paste), reset receipt, preview pictures for all clips
- Video playback in 2 modes: show each frame or drop frame mode (a kind of realtime playback which shows as many frames your computer can render)
- Audio playback in video drop frame mode
- Loop playback
- Show next frame, previous frame and scroll though timeline
- Single frame (3x)16bit PNG export
- Clip export via ffmpeg 10bit ProRes 422 (Proxy, LT, Standard, HQ), ProRes 4444, and RAW AVI; all with or without audio
- Frame rate override for export and playback
- Clip batch export
- Zoom: fit to screen, 100% and free zoom, scroll through picture

## Compiling :collision:
#### Cocoa App
```
git clone https://github.com/ilia3101/MLV-App.git
cd MLV-App/platform/cocoa
make app -j4
```

#### Qt App macOS
- install XCode depending on your OSX
- install Qt5 (minimum 5.6)
- unpack libpng-1.6.31.tar.gz (don't know how to do in terminal)
- `cd platform/qt/libpng16/` `./configure`    `make check`     `sudo make install`
- unpack ffmpegOSX.zip in `platform/qt/FFmpeg`
- open `platform/qt/MLVApp.pro` in QtCreator
- go to tab project, add command line argument -j4 (for quad core) under build steps, uncheck Add build library search path to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH checkbox in my project Run section
- Build and Start

#### Qt App Windows
- install Qt5 (minimum 5.6)
- unpack ffmpegWin.zip in `platform/qt/FFmpeg` (and copy it later into build directory)
- open `platform/qt/MLVApp.pro` in QtCreator
- go to tab project, add command line argument -j4 (for quad core) under build steps, uncheck Add build library search path to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH checkbox in my project Run section
- Build and Start

#### Qt App Linux (generally)
- install Qt5 (minimum 5.6), ffmpeg (we use v3.3.2) and zlib (the steps to get these three items are different on all distros)
- `cd platform/qt/libpng16/`
- unpack libpng-1.6.31.tar.gz (don't know how to do in terminal)
- `./configure`    `make check`     `sudo make install`
- `cd..`
- `qmake MLVApp.pro` or equivalent (depending on distro and version and...)
- `make -j4` (for quad core)
- `./mlvapp` and have fun

## The Code
All the MLV stuff is in src/mlv

Image processing is in src/processing

Other stuff also in src/...

Platform specific/GUI things in platform/...

#### A note about code style
You may notice a strange mixture of these styles: 
1. `thisNameStyle`
2. `this_name_style`

The rule I have used in the libraries is: public functions use the thisNameStyle, and private functions use this_one.
Keep it in mind if you're going to be adding something major.
